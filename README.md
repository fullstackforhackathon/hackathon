## Easy way to create action types
Use cratn snippet for this: write "cratn" -> push tab -> enter action type name -> push tab to uppercase;

```
import { constantGenerator } from "../utils/ConstantGenerator";

export const { UPLOAD_FILE, UPLOAD_FILE_PENDING, UPLOAD_FILE_FULFILLED, UPLOAD_FILE_REJECTED } = constantGenerator("UPLOAD_FILE");
```

## Components development
We have story book to develop components.
Use `$yarn storybook` to run server with it.
Don't install any packages when storybook is runing
